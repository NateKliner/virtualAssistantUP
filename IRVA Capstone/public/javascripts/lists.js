        responsibilities, and procedures (National Forum on Education Statistics, 2011). Essentially, the ambitious charge for stakeholders involved \
        in data governance is to develop and support data practices that promote institutional mission fulfillment, support informed decisions, \
        and facilitate strategic planning.  Ensuring a solid data foundation obliges the collaborative work of leaders and experts across campus \
        attending to what falls under the data governance umbrella: data definitions, process ownership and authority, accountability, security and \
        privacy, data access, reporting needs and requirements, and research priorities. A culture of data informed decision-making requires that the universityâ€™s \
        data infrastructure be sound and that campus stakeholders are empowered with timely and accurate data.  A continuous investment of \
        collective time and resources is necessary to meet todayâ€™s extensive demand for informed and nimble decision-making across the university. \
        As an advocate for robust data governance, the Office of Institutional Research at UP hopes to broadly empower the wise use of data by all \
        stakeholders involved in achieving the institutional mission. As increasing numbers of data consumers collect and access data, this diffuse \
        network has the potential to expedite data informed decision-making at the significant risk of creating redundant data silos.  Data governance \
        encompasses both the top-down and grassroots strategies that establish effective university-wide data practices. The work is not simple, however \
